# Maven-Electronics-Analysis
My first Powerbi project that shaping my knowledge in turning raw data into actionable insight

## Objective:

This dashboard shows the report of Maven global electronics retailer to consolidate and analyze sales, customer, product, and store data. The dashboard shows key performance metrics, uncover sales trends, and provide actionable insights for management to make data-driven decisions.

## Company Overview:


Maven Electronics is a global retailer that sells computers, cell phones, TVs, cameras, appliances, and other consumer products through both online and in-store channels. The company operates across multiple regions and aims to improve profitability, monitor store and product performance, and enhance customer
satisfaction.

## Business Problem:

Revenue has been on a downward trend since 2020, and management currently lacks a unified view of performance across sales channels, regions, and customer demographics. Without an interactive dashboard, it is difficult to identify top performing products, regions, and customer segments, or to understand areas of declining performance. Management needs a consolidated data model and an interactive report to explore key sales drivers, monitor revenue and profit trends, and evaluate store and product-level performance.

### Product Performance
!(Product dashboard )[<img width="967" height="544" alt="maven_1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc84a735-9ec9-4424-9bbf-8bd43643b94f" />]


**Top Performers Drive Revenue:**

Premium products like Desktops, TVs, and Smartphones remain profitable, while accessories (chargers, cables, camcorders) are dragging down margins.

**Category Imbalance:**

Computers (52% of profit) dominate earnings, but Music, Audio, and Games-related products show sharp profit decline, reducing overall stability.

#### Action: 

Focus on high-demand tech, bundle weak products, and innovate in smart devices/wearables.


### Customer Performance

**Demographics:** 

Balanced gender revenue (Male 51% / Female 49%). Older (34.5%) and Young Adults (30.1%) are key segments, while Youth (6.1%) are under-engaged.

**Geography:** 

Revenue highly concentrated in a few states (California, Louisiana, Georgia).

**Profitability:** 

Small group of top customers drive most revenue; many low-value customers add cost with little return.

**Seasonality:** 

Peaks in Jan–Feb & Dec, Dip in April–May and mid-year months show stagnation


##### Action: 

Target youth with trendy tech, expand beyond top states, launch mid-year campaigns, and strengthen loyalty for top customers.


### Regional & Store Performance

**Geography:**

North America = 62% of revenue (U.S. $24M).

Europe = 33% (led by UK & Germany).

Australia = 5%; no presence in Asia, Africa.


**State-Level:** 

Online sales outperform physical stores; Nevada & Florida are top states, others underperform.

**Store Age:**

Mid-aged stores (11–15 yrs) generate 59% of revenue.

Older stores (16+ yrs) show stagnation.

Younger stores (6–9 yrs) show growth potential but need scale.



#### Action:

Expand digital channels globally, enter Asia-Pacific & Africa, modernize older stores, and accelerate younger store growth.


## Strategic Recommendations

**Digital First:** 

Strengthen e-commerce & online subscriptions to reduce dependency on physical stores.

**Geographic Expansion:** 

Move beyond North America & Europe into Asia and Africa via partnerships.

**Customer Diversification:** 

Engage younger customers with trendy, affordable products while retaining high-value clients.

**Product Focus:** 

Streamline low-margin products and invest in innovation (smart appliances, wearables, smart home devices).

**Store Portfolio Optimization:** 

Refurbish or repurpose older stores; push younger stores with localized campaigns.


## Conclusion:
Maven Electronics has a strong foundation but faces risk from over-reliance on a few products, customers, and regions. To return to sustainable growth, the company must diversify products, expand globally, digitize aggressively, and balance its customer and store portfolio for the next decade.
